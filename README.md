# C++ Practice (First Year)

This repository contains my beginner C++ practice programs from my first year of Software Engineering.

## Programs
- **calculator.cpp** — A simple calculator that supports `+ - * /` and checks for division by zero.

## How to run
Compile and run using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
./calculator
