# C++ Practice (First Year)

This repository contains my beginner C++ practice programs from my first year of Software Engineering.

## Programs
- **calculator.cpp** — A simple calculator that supports `+ - * /` and checks for division by zero.
- **guessing_game.cpp** — A number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1-100. The program provides hints (higher/lower), counts attempts, validates input, and allows replay. 

## How to run
Compile and run using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
./calculator

g++ guessing_game.cpp -o guessing_game
./guessing_game
